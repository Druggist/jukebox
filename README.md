# Jukebox

Jukebox is a client-server application. The server plays songs that are chosen by the clients in a vote. Before each song server randomly picks eight songs from the playlist and sends them to the clients. After that clients can vote which song they want to hear next. When the previous song is over server plays next song that has the most votes.
